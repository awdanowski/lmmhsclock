LMMHS School Schedule Clock

## Getting Started

Lenox Memorial Middle and High School in Lenox, MA has a very confusing daily schedule.
There are eight class periods, A - H. On Monday, all eight periods meet, but on Tuesday through
Friday, two classes are dropped each day.

In addition, there are three different Lunch periods because the cafeteria is too small to hold
everyone.

So while some people might be in F period, others are in G period, or maybe eating lunch.

The whole thing gets confusing and everyone is constantly referring to printed diagrams to figure
out what period it is and how long until the next period and when lunch happens.

So I am making an app.

Not sure that it would be of any use to anyone else, but take a look if you want.
